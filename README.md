This is an experimental project to see how far AI can get you while working on a web app end-to-end.

UI is based on template generated by [Vercel](https://v0.dev/), and code is based on [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/) and [CursorAI](https://cursor.sh/).

My findings so far:
- You still need to know what you're doing. AI output is good, but it is still prone for hallucinations, especially at tasks like "optimize this code", where it might delete a lot of actually necessary code.
- CursorAI is great for suggesting code changes, and it can save you a lot of time. Out-of-the-box experience for chatting and applying code changes feels more natural than Github Copilot, and feels like actual AI partner developer.

To run:
- `npm install`
- `npm run dev`
- Audio WebAPIs require HTTPS, so the easiest way to to use `ngrok` or Azure DevTunnel to have a public URL hosted behind HTTPS.
  - For Azure DevTunnel - use `devtunnel host -p 3000`
